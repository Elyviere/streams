A quick and dirty practice project for using Optional and Stream in Java.

Look at the methods in src/main/java/com/PersonUtil.java and try to rewrite them in src/main/java/com/PersonUtil**Streams**.java, using only `Optional` and `Stream` over `null` and `for(...)`.

Each method has a unit test to go along with it, so you can always run the matching test in /src/**test**/java/com/Person**TestStreams**.java. If you want to run all tests, simply run `mvn test` in your terminal while standing in the root folder. With a clean repository, all tests in /src/test/java/com/PersonTest.java should pass, whereas all tests in PersonTest**Streams**.java will fail.

Suggested answers can be found in src/main/java/com/PersonUtilStreams**Example**.java.

Enjoy, and please let me know if you found this exercise helpful!
